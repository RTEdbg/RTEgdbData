# The file was generated by STM32CubeIDE for the STM32H743ZITx chip. 
# The 'Reset mode' was set to 'none' in the IDE debugger settings.
# The 'Enable debug in low power modes' and 'Stop watchdog counters 
# on halt' were selected, as well as the 'Shared ST-LINK'.
#
# The following modifications have been done:
# A) The '-gdb-max-connections 4' has been added at the end to override
#    the same parameter (value = 2) in the 'target/stm32h7x.cfg' file.
#    Modify the settings according to your hardware limitations and 
#    project requirements.
#
# B) The "st-link backend tcp" has been disabled. 
#    Enable it if you'll use the ST-LINK server as backend.
